# Documented company–facility–grid relationships

The register in `src/data/verifiedRelationships.json` contains manually reviewed primary-source relationships. It is a small evidence register, not a complete map of company assets or grid service territories. A record requires a tracked ticker, named facility, region, grid, publication date, review date and an exact HTTPS page from an approved official host. The UI shows the review date; the static register is not rechecked by the daily source job.

## ORCL · Abilene · ERCOT

- **Primary source:** [Oracle, “Oracle Invests in More Than 1.7 GW of Carbon-Free Electricity to Support AI Growth and Strengthen the Texas Grid”](https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-invests-in-more-than-1.7-gw-of-carbon-free-electricity-to-support-ai-growth-and-strengthen-the-texas-grid-2026-08-15/).
- **Published:** September 15, 2026. **Reviewed:** September 29, 2026.
- **Supported relationship:** Oracle identifies its Abilene facility in Texas and says the ERCOT grid powers it.
- **Boundary:** This source does not measure Abilene's actual electricity demand, establish how much of ERCOT load is attributable to Oracle, or explain ORCL's share-price changes. The dashboard's measured EIA load series is for PJM, so its grid-demand card remains unavailable for Texas.

Add another relationship only after reviewing an exact primary page that explicitly names both the company and facility or grid. Record its source and review date, and keep unsupported joins unavailable.
