# Ingestion API

Run the API with `npm run api`, or run the API and React UI together with `npm run dev`. The API listens on `http://localhost:8787` by default. Copy `.env.example` to a local environment file or export its values before running provider ingestion.

The API binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. If it is deliberately exposed on a network, set `HOST`, restrict `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, and configure a long random `API_WRITE_TOKEN`. All state-changing POST endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` outside loopback and are rate limited. Do not place this token in the static React build. Public observation and score queries are paginated and bounded.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/health` | Per-source status, latest success and degradation reason. |
| `GET /api/observations?ticker=ORCL&type=close` | Normalized historical observations. |
| `GET /api/provenance?observationId=...` | Provenance for one normalized observation. |
| `GET /api/scores?ticker=NBIS` | Current-version price-signal snapshots; legacy curated scores are excluded. |
| `POST /api/ingest?source=prices` | Refresh one adapter. Sources: `sec`, `eia`, `pjm`, `ferc`, `company-ir`, `prices`. |
| `POST /api/ingest/all` | Refresh all adapters independently; unavailable credentials degrade only that source. |
| `POST /api/scenario` | Run/persist one scenario analysis. |
| `POST /api/backtest` | Run/persist one point-in-time backtest. |

## Storage model

Gridline keeps two deployment profiles:

- **API / production-style profile:** raw responses are archived under `data/bronze`; normalized observations, source health, versioned score snapshots, scenario runs and backtest runs are persisted in SQLite/WAL. Observation identity is deterministic, so ingesting the same source row again is idempotent and does not erase prior history.
- **GitHub Pages demo profile:** the scheduled exporter writes `public/data/dashboard-snapshot.json`. Successful sources replace their prior static-source records; degraded sources retain last-known-good observations.

`data/` is intentionally ignored by Git. The committed static snapshot is a portable public-demo artifact, not the API database.

## Provider requirements

- **SEC EDGAR:** public API, server-side only. `SEC_USER_AGENT` is mandatory and must identify the caller. Filing availability time must be preserved separately from the filing period.
- **EIA:** API key required. The starter connector reads PJM hourly RTO regional data.
- **PJM Data Miner 2:** a PJM account/API subscription key is required. The starter connector reads `gen_by_fuel`; comply with PJM terms before redistribution.
- **Data.FERC.gov:** API key required. The starter connector validates/snapshots the dataset catalog; choose and configure a specific production dataset before treating FERC as a live indicator.
- **Company IR:** configure only official RSS/Atom URLs in `COMPANY_IR_FEEDS`. Raw source material is retained for later parser/version upgrades.
- **Prices:** Stooq is attempted first for the public demo. If the response is empty, stale, undersized or otherwise unusable, Gridline falls back per ticker to the Yahoo Finance chart endpoint. Each configured ticker must have at least 60 usable daily rows and a recent market observation before the `prices` source can be healthy. For a finance-company production deployment, replace demo feeds with an approved/licensed market-data provider.

The actual provider and origin URL used for each price observation are carried in provenance metadata.

## Fail-closed ingestion

An HTTP `200` does not imply a healthy data refresh. After adapter execution, normalized price, SEC and grid observations must contain usable records. Empty results are marked `degraded`. The event adapter may validly return zero verified events; it records a dated check and retains prior event history.

For the static snapshot, a degraded source retains last-known-good data. For the SQLite profile, immutable historical observations remain present. This is particularly important for price history because 30D/90D lookbacks and point-in-time backtests depend on continuity.

No missing response is converted to zero.

## Demo acceptance

After generating a static snapshot, run:

```bash
npm run demo:check
```

The gate checks schema-v4 metadata, complete/recent market-price coverage for all tracked tickers, and non-zero semantics for healthy non-event sources. Historical v1 reconstruction is no longer required or published. The scheduled snapshot workflow runs this gate before committing an updated public snapshot.

Use `#health` / **Research Lab → Data health** to inspect the same committed snapshot from the UI.

## EIA attribution and integrity

When an EIA-derived observation is displayed, identify the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) as its source and link to EIA Open Data. Keep the raw EIA observation, observation period, and retrieval time separate from Gridline-derived metrics. Do not use the EIA logo or language that implies EIA endorsement of the dashboard, scores, or investment conclusions.

EIA data is scoped to Gridline’s research and decision-support use only. Do not send it to unrelated products or services, and do not remove its attribution or time context when presenting it.

## Scheduling

With `SCHEDULE_ENABLED=true`, the local API scheduler checks once per minute and may trigger one refresh at or after **4:15 PM America/New_York**, Monday through Friday. The GitHub Pages snapshot workflow separately runs at `22:00 UTC` on weekdays and also supports manual dispatch. Market holidays are handled by the historical-price validation/tolerance rules rather than by inventing a price for a closed session.

For a demo, this is deliberately a low-frequency model rather than continuous polling. Production provider licensing, SLAs, historical-vintage availability and redistribution rights remain deployment responsibilities outside this repository's demo configuration.
