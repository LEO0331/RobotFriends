# Gridline — Data Center Infrastructure Intelligence

Gridline is a bilingual, focused research workflow for one question: **Is the data-center buildout showing up in grid demand, project decisions, company disclosures, and market prices?** It brings dated evidence and its original sources together so a researcher can examine those four views without treating correlation as causation.

Broker platforms support trading, while [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/portfolios) already provides watchlists, market data, news, charts and research. Gridline's contribution is a narrower, source-first investigation: show what each record supports, when it was last checked, and where evidence is missing. It does not have exclusive market data or demonstrated predictive skill, and it is not an automated trading system or investment advice.

Public demo: [Gridline](https://leo0331.github.io/RobotFriends/)

## The research workflow

| Question | Current evidence | What it cannot establish alone |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Is grid demand changing? | Complete, comparable days of EIA-reported actual PJM load. | Regional load does not isolate data centers or prove that a project secured power. |
| Are projects moving forward or meeting constraints? | Dated, verified primary-source permitting, grid and company records, with each record's last successful check date. | A milestone does not quantify capacity or establish an effect on a tracked company without a documented link. |
| What did companies disclose? | Period-aware SEC revenue and diluted EPS facts linked to filings. | A disclosure alone does not establish earnings quality, valuation or buildout attribution. |
| How have market prices behaved? | Dated closes, descriptive trend/momentum/volatility methods and a separate retrospective price test. | Price behavior does not explain its cause or prove future returns. |

Start with a company or region, inspect the four evidence views, open the underlying records, and check source dates and gaps in Data Health. The researcher makes the synthesis; the dashboard does not combine these views into a buy/sell score. A new feature belongs in the primary workflow only if it answers one of these questions with a dated source, an explicit rule and a clear evidence boundary.

## What the demo demonstrates

- **Infrastructure intelligence** — region navigation and verified primary-source milestones; unsourced regional capacity/stage figures are withheld.
- **Price lookback** — 30D / 90D / 1Y observed closes with explicit insufficient-history states.
- **Lightweight price chart** — native SVG 30 / 60 / 90-session views use the same dated close observations, keep one continuous provider segment, link back to the price source, and overlay dated state-change markers from the currently selected technical method.
- **Previous-snapshot diff** — each refresh compares material customer-facing changes against the immediately preceding committed snapshot: latest closes, recorded trend-signal state, verified event additions/updates/archive transitions, and source-health status.
- **Demo hardening** — explicit snapshot loading/error/empty states, retry, observation-recency labels, keyboard-inspectable SVG charts, modal focus handling, visible focus states, skip navigation, and mobile navigation that remains available below desktop widths.
- **Auditable provenance** — deterministic observation IDs, provider/source metadata, observation and retrieval dates, origin URLs and lineage.
- **Extensible technical signals** — a common registry covers trend/moving averages, RSI momentum and Bollinger volatility with dated evidence, provider continuity checks and descriptive states rather than buy/sell verdicts.
- **Persistent history** — the Node API profile stores immutable observations, source health, score snapshots, scenario runs and backtest runs in SQLite/WAL.
- **Scenario Lab (supporting worksheet)** — records bounded user assumptions for power, demand, CAPEX and regulation without presenting them as observed evidence or an uncalibrated forecast.
- **Retrospective price test (method check)** — MA5/MA10 crossover outcomes using the next observed session and a ten-session exit, with pending windows and no-look-ahead rules; it does not test the whole buildout thesis.
- **Data Health** — `#health` exposes market-snapshot freshness, source status, price coverage, and the separately dated event review.
- **Fail-closed ingestion** — empty/invalid provider responses are degraded, not successful; last-known-good history is retained.
- **Bilingual research UX** — core Research Lab workflows support English and Traditional Chinese.
- **Optional accounts** — Supabase signup/signin/recovery/preferences are implemented in the React project but do not block the public research demo.
- **Engineering quality gates** — PR tests/build/audit, static-snapshot acceptance checks, GitHub Pages deployment and Lighthouse CI.

## Next research improvements (not yet implemented)

1. **A question-level evidence summary:** show the four lanes together for a selected company or region, with supported, missing, stale or conflicting evidence and direct record links. Do not infer a single investment verdict.
2. **Sourced company–project–grid relationships:** connect a company to a facility, permit or grid region only when an official record states that relationship. Until then, keep regional demand separate from company-specific conclusions.
3. **Coverage and change context:** distinguish a feed check from complete coverage, surface failed or unreviewed candidate links, and explain material changes since the previous snapshot before adding more technical indicators.

## Requirements

- Node.js **22+** (`node:sqlite` is used by the API/storage profile)
- npm using the committed `package-lock.json`

## Quick start

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` starts both:

- React UI: `http://localhost:3000/RobotFriends`
- Research API: `http://localhost:8787`

Use `Ctrl+C` to stop both processes. For UI-only development, use `npm start`. For API-only development, use `npm run api`.

Provider configuration is documented in [.env.example](.env.example) and the [ingestion guide](docs/api-ingestion.md).

GitHub Pages profile:
provider refresh → full + compact snapshots → consistency/readiness gate
                → commit both to main → explicit Pages dispatch
                → Pages build/deploy → Lighthouse CI
```

Key modules:

- `server/sources.js` — SEC, EIA, event and market-price adapters used by the public demo; PJM Data Miner, FERC and company IR adapters are optional API experiments and do not feed its current lenses.
- `server/price-history.js` — validated Stooq history plus Yahoo Finance demo fallback.
- `server/service.js` — cache/source health and zero-row fail-closed behavior.
- `server/provenance.js` — deterministic observation identity and audit metadata.
- `server/database.js` / `server/store.js` — SQLite schema and persistent research history.
- `server/scoring/` — versioned MA5/MA10 signal from cited prices; unsupported company scores are null.
- `server/scenario-engine.js` — bounded user assumptions without an uncalibrated forecast.
- `server/backtest.js` / `src/backtestModel.js` — retrospective price-only MA5/MA10 crossover test.
- `server/historical-reconstruction.js` — recorded-history coverage summary; no v1 reconstructions are generated.
- `server/demo-readiness.js` — public-snapshot acceptance criteria.
- `src/signals/registry.js` — common frontend contract for trend, momentum and volatility methods; calculations fail closed when the latest provider segment is insufficient.
- `src/Components/PriceChart.js` / `src/Components/priceChartModel.js` — dependency-free SVG price history using the same normalized, source-continuous close observations as the signal layer.
- `src/Components/chartSignalMarkers.js` — maps the selected registered method's dated events onto matching visible chart observations without recalculating indicator logic in the chart.
- `server/snapshot-changes.js` / `src/Components/SnapshotChanges.js` — deterministic previous-snapshot comparison plus the bilingual Overview audit surface.
- `src/Components/SnapshotLoadState.js` / `src/freshness.js` — explicit snapshot lifecycle states and shared market-observation recency presentation.
- `src/DataHealth.js` — operational/demo-readiness workspace.
- `src/ScenarioLab.js` / `src/BacktestLab.js` — research workflows.

The storage interface is deliberately narrow so SQLite can be replaced by Postgres in a production deployment without rewriting the scoring/scenario/backtest domain logic.

## Research API

The API is local-only by default (`127.0.0.1`). If deliberately exposed on a network, configure `HOST`, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and a long random `API_WRITE_TOKEN`; state-changing requests outside loopback require the bearer token. Never put that token in the static React build.

Selected endpoints:

```text
GET  /api/health
GET  /api/observations
GET  /api/provenance?observationId=...
GET  /api/scores?ticker=NBIS
POST /api/ingest?source=prices
POST /api/scenario
GET  /api/scenario/runs
POST /api/backtest
GET  /api/backtest/runs
```

See [docs/api-ingestion.md](docs/api-ingestion.md).

## Market-price ingestion

The public demo attempts Stooq first. If a ticker's history is empty, stale, undersized or unusable, it falls back to the Yahoo Finance chart endpoint. A healthy `prices` refresh requires every configured ticker to have at least 60 usable recent daily observations.

An HTTP `200` with zero usable rows is **degraded**, not `ok`. Degraded refreshes do not erase existing history. Provider identity and origin URL are preserved in provenance. Free demo feeds should be replaced by an approved/licensed market-data provider for commercial finance use.

## Niche signal lenses and retrospective test

The Overview lets a researcher switch between **market signals**, **company execution**, **grid demand**, and **project milestones**. Each lens shows its source, date, rule, and unavailable state. It avoids a composite buy/sell score. Company execution uses period-aware SEC revenue or diluted EPS only when an exact record link exists. Grid demand requires explicitly typed EIA actual load and complete comparable days. Project milestones require exact primary records. See [Signal lenses](docs/signal-lenses.md) and [Market signal methodology](docs/scoring-methodology.md).

The frontend signal explorer exposes three conventional technical-analysis families under one result contract: moving-average trend, 14-period Wilder RSI momentum, and 20-period Bollinger volatility bands. Users can switch methods on the Overview; that same selection drives the Market signals lens, the “About this signal” drawer, and dated state-change markers on the price chart. Marker hover text explains the event state while keeping the visualization descriptive rather than turning technical changes into buy/sell instructions. See [Technical signal methods](docs/signal-methods.md).

The MA5/MA10 backtest uses only dated closes, enters at the next observed session close and evaluates ten observed sessions later. It is a retrospective descriptive calculation with no transaction costs or claim of predictive skill. See [Backtesting](docs/backtesting.md).

## Verification

Code quality gate:

```bash
npm run verify
```

Equivalent commands:

```bash
npm run test:api
npm run test:unit
npm run build
```

After generating a current static snapshot, validate the public-demo data state:

```bash
npm run demo:check
```

Or run both code verification and snapshot acceptance:

```bash
npm run verify:demo
```

`verify:demo` is intentionally stricter than PR CI and can fail when the committed snapshot is old/incomplete. PR CI validates code independently of live provider availability.

## Static daily snapshot and Pages deployment

`Refresh daily dashboard snapshot` runs daily at **22:17 UTC** and supports manual dispatch. It checks the NYSE calendar before fetching market prices; SEC, EIA and event sources can refresh on non-trading days. It retries sources, preserves last-known-good data for degraded providers, generates a schemaVersion 4 full snapshot and compact Overview projection, then runs `npm run demo:check`.

Both snapshot files must agree exactly and pass the demo-critical gate before they are committed to `main`. The refresh workflow then explicitly dispatches `Deploy to GitHub Pages`, which performs a Node 22 lockfile install, production build, Pages deployment and Lighthouse CI. This explicit dispatch is necessary because a push made by a workflow using the repository `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not itself start another push-triggered workflow.

The gate requires usable recent price history for all four tracked tickers. Historical v1 reconstructions are no longer published or required. Optional degraded providers remain visible as warnings.

Deployment runbook: [English](docs/static-snapshot-deployment.en.md) · [繁體中文](docs/static-snapshot-deployment.zh-TW.md).

## Data Health

Open **Research Lab → Data health** or navigate to `#health` to inspect the same committed snapshot used by the public dashboard. It reports:

- generation time / age;
- source health and degradation reasons;
- per-ticker price row count, range and provider;
- retained unique event-record count and source check dates;
- `PRICE DATA AVAILABLE`, `PRICE DATA AVAILABLE · SOURCE GAPS`, or `PRICE COVERAGE INCOMPLETE`.

This is an operational transparency surface, not a claim that every optional provider is currently live.

## Optional Supabase accounts

The React project contains signup, email confirmation/resend, sign-in, session restoration, password recovery/change, preference load/save and sign-out. The public research demo remains usable without Supabase configuration.

To demonstrate live accounts, configure the project, redirects, RLS SQL and browser-safe publishable variables as described in [docs/accounts.en.md](docs/accounts.en.md). No service-role/secret key belongs in the frontend.

## EIA attribution

Where EIA observations appear, Gridline identifies the **U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)** as the source and retains observation/retrieval timestamps. Gridline's derived grid-demand comparison is not produced, endorsed or approved by EIA. Keep attribution and time context with any displayed result.
